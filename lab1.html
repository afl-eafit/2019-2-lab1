    <h1 style="text-align:center;">Programming Lab 1: Converting
    Non-Deterministic Finite Automata to Deterministic Finite
    Automata</h1>

    <h3>TA: Alejandro Murillo G.</h3>

    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>While non-deterministic finite automata and deterministic
    finite automata describe languages differently, both actually
    represent the same type of languages, the "regular languages"
    [Hopcroft, Motwani and Ullman 2007]. The goal of this programming
    lab is to convert NFAs to DFAs to show that both of them are
    equally powerful.</p>

    <h3>Assignment (80%)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Download the<a href="https://github.com/"> GitHub </a>
        repository <a
        href="https://github.com/afl-eafit/2019-1-lab1">2019-1-lab1</a>.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>(70%) Using the data types in the above repository define a
        function:</p>
        <pre> nfa2dfa :: FiniteAutomata state symbol -&gt;
        FiniteAutomata (Set state) symbol
        </pre>
        <p>that takes a non-deterministic finite automaton and
        returns a deterministic finite automaton that defines the
        same language. The obtained DFA should only contain reachable
         states.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        (10%)
        <ul>
          <li>Your lab will be tested using the <code>-Wall</code>,
          <code>-Wmissing-local-signatures</code> and
          <code>-Wmissing-signatures</code> options.</li>

          <li>Annotate (in English) your source code using <a
          href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/haddock">Haddock</a>. Documentation
          should explain your solution for the assignment.</li>

          <li>Improve your implementation with <a
          href="https://github.com/ndmitchell/hlint">HLint</a>.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>The programming lab may either be solved on your own, or
        jointly with one other student taking the course.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>You are to use GHC[i] &ge; 8.6.3.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Examples</h3>
    <p>Using the <code>FiniteAutomata.hs</code> modules in the above
    GitHub repository, this is what a sample input-output looks
    like:</p>
    <pre> GHCi&gt; nfa2dfa example0
 States:         fromList [fromList ["q0"],fromList ["q0","q1"],fromList ["q0","q2"]]
 Alphabet:       fromList [0,1]
 Delta:          fromList [(fromList ["q0"],fromList [(0,fromList [fromList ["q0","q1"]]),(1,fromList [fromList ["q0"]])]),(fromList ["q0","q1"],fromList [(0,fromList [fromList ["q0","q1"]]),(1,fromList [fromList ["q0","q2"]])]),(fromList ["q0","q2"],fromList [(0,fromList [fromList ["q0","q1"]]),(1,fromList [fromList ["q0"]])])]
 Initial States: fromList ["q0"]
 Accept States:  fromList [fromList ["q0","q2"]]

 GHCi&gt; nfa2dfa example1
 States:         fromList [fromList [1],fromList [1,2],fromList [1,2,3],fromList [1,3],fromList [3]]

 Initial States: fromList [1]
 Accept States:  fromList [fromList [1,2,3],fromList [1,3],fromList [3]]

 GHCi&gt; nfa2dfa example2
 States:         fromList [fromList "A",fromList "ABCDE",fromList "B",fromList "BDE",fromList "C",fromList "CE",fromList "DE",fromList "E"]
 Alphabet:       fromList [0,1]
